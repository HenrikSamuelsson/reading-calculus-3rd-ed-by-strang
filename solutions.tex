\begin{enumerate}
    \item A graph of a function $f$ that goes up, down, and up again is drawn to the left in the below figure. To the right there is graph showing the corresponding slope of the first graph. Note that the slope is positive when $f$ goes up and negative when $f$ goes down. Also note how the slope is largest when $f$ goes up the fastest.
